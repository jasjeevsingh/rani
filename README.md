## 🎯 What is RANI?

RANI transforms your desktop into an intelligent research companion that:

🧠 **Understands Your Research Context** — Sees your screen, listens to meetings, and maintains conversation history to provide contextually aware assistance

📚 **Analyzes Documents** — Upload and annotate PDFs, extract insights, and connect ideas across papers

🔍 **Discovers Related Work** — Suggests relevant papers and helps explore research connections

⚗️ **Enables Experimentation** — Provides an integrated coding environment for testing formulas and concepts

💬 **Collaborates Like a Colleague** — Responds as a helpful research partner who says "let's work this out together"
